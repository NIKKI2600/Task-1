Steps Performed
1. Identified and handled missing values using `.isnull()` in Python.
2. Removed duplicate rows using `.drop_duplicates()` or Excel’s “Remove Duplicates”.
3. Standardized text values like gender, country names, etc.
4. Converted date formats to a consistent type (e.g., `dd-mm-yyyy`).
5. Renamed column headers to be clean and uniform (e.g., lowercase, no spaces).
6. Checked and fixed data types (e.g., age as `int`, date as `datetime`).
